//! T-050-c (VIEW-019): a live agent detected in the pane decides chat or terminal over what the
//! session was launched as. A shell where the user typed `claude` by hand, an orchestrator worker
//! or a typed command (panes with no program of Kolux's own) show chat once an agent is in front;
//! a launch whose program changed (the first one exited, another was typed) follows the new one;
//! an agent that exited hands the pane back to its terminal. The detection itself is the ACCT-050
//! process walk in `foreground.rs`; this module adds the root process to it, the decision, the
//! clock a hand-started transcript is looked for from, and a looser transcript search for a
//! session Kolux did not start (its shell may have moved folders).
