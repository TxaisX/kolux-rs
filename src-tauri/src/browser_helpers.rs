//! T-283 (BROW-043): leftover browser helper processes are cleaned up.
//!
//! The helpers are the engine's own browser processes behind the app's pages. Each one is recorded
//! when a page opens, with the moment the system says it started, its program file and the app
//! run that owns it (the app's own process id and start moment), in a small file in the profile
//! folder. Nothing is ever chosen by program name alone:
//! - at start, a record from an earlier run is closed only when that run is gone (its owner no
//!   longer runs, or its id now belongs to a later process) AND the recorded process still runs
//!   with the same start moment and program file; records this run owns are left alone;
//! - at quit, the helpers this run recorded are stopped, again only while their start moment
//!   still matches (a reused process id is never touched).
//!
//! The start-up sweep runs on its own thread, so a listing that hangs or fails never holds up
//! start-up, and one failed close does not stop the rest. Setting the environment variable named
//! in `SWEEP_OFF_VAR` to an explicit on-value (1, true, yes, on) switches the sweep off; any other
//! value still sweeps. No helper here has an idle time-out of its own (the engine's processes live
//! as long as their pages), so none can cut a command short.
