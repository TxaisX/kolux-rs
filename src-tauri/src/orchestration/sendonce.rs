//! ORCH-055 (T-174-b): prompts typed into agents land exactly once. One `Send` is a small state
//! machine the command line drives: wait until the agent's input box has drawn and settled (a late
//! redraw restarts that wait), paste the text once, hold Enter back for a pause that grows with the
//! prompt's size (and, for a large paste, until the agent has taken it in), then press Enter exactly
//! once. Enter is held back when another writer takes the session, when a permission prompt shows,
//! or when the user cancels; nothing is pasted while a permission prompt shows. `Receipts` keeps a
//! `terminal send` receipt in the store, so a retry after a restart answers instead of sending
//! again; `lane` serialises the senders of one terminal so sixteen queued prompts give sixteen
//! turns; `proves_arrival` says a working report dated before the send is no proof it arrived.
