//! TERM-122 / APP-018: keep the computer awake while agents run. Off by default; On holds always;
//! Agent (Auto) holds only while an agent pane is believably working. The choice sits on Settings >
//! Agents under the `keepAwake` key ("off", "agent", "on"); an older plain `true` reads as Agent.
//! Windows asks the system through SetThreadExecutionState on the watcher's own thread (the request
//! belongs to the thread that made it); macOS runs `caffeinate`, Linux `systemd-inhibit` (which also
//! blocks sleep on lid close). A missing tool or a refused hold quietly does nothing, is logged
//! once and is asked for again once a minute.
// T-223: lib.rs starts the watcher and registers the command, and status.rs gains working_now and
// terminal_ended; both are coordinator patches (evidence/launch-FIX-2-status.patch, then
// evidence/launch-FIX-2-wiring.patch). Until they land this module is not compiled at all.
