//! What an older profile brings into this one.
//!
//! APP-004 (T-213): on the first launch, settings saved by the former product (Nightshift) carry
//! over, through an allow-list. The former profile folder is found beside this profile in the
//! system's application-data folder, in any letter case; finding it only points at it. Exactly one
//! file in it is read: its settings file (`settings.json`, or the same name under the former product's
//! name), never through a link and never past a size cap. Each saved setting takes the current name
//! through the renaming rule (`nightshiftX` becomes `koluxX`, the `nightshift.` interface prefix becomes
//! `kolux.`) and carries only when that name is on [`carried`], its value has the listed shape, and
//! neither its name nor its value looks like a secret. A value already saved here wins; nothing is
//! ever copied raw, no file of the former folder is copied, and every other item there (hook scripts,
//! key vault, cookies, transcripts, caches) is counted as skipped without being opened (COMPAT 5.2,
//! 5.3; OD-05). The summary carries counts only, never a skipped name or value.
//!
//! It runs once per profile, in the background after the window shows, under a lock file; the
//! settings write is the store's own (a temp file renamed into place, the last good copy kept).
//! Development, test and lane profiles never get it (`agent_hooks::fenced`). A settings file here
//! that cannot be read stops it without marking it done, so a later launch tries again.
//! Not carried yet: project, repo and worktree records, whose former shape no allowed source
//! describes (T-213-b).
//!
//! HID-036 (T-331): settings retired before this rebuild are dropped quietly from an older profile,
//! with no message and no failed load, and never come back: `without_retired` is the filter the
//! settings load and save apply (coordinator hunk in state.rs, T-331 commit body), and the
//! carry-over applies it to what it brings in. A retired setting is recognised by its exact old
//! spelling only, so a key a newer build writes is never dropped.
