; T-574, T-578: the installer no longer installs the coding agents. People pick the ones they want when Kolux
; opens (first-run wizard and Settings > Agents), and Kolux installs just those, several at once.
; T-594 (CLI-007): a new terminal finds kolux. The installer puts the install's bin folder (kolux.exe and
; kolux.cmd, DT-R27) on the user's PATH when it is missing, and the uninstaller takes exactly that entry off
; again. The rules are cli_register.rs's (CLI-008): the variable keeps its name and is written as
; REG_EXPAND_SZ (a PATH stored as REG_SZ comes back as REG_EXPAND_SZ, which Windows reads the same way),
; the change is read back before it is reported, and no other entry is ever touched.
; T-594, a PATH over the NSIS limit: NSIS strings hold 1024 characters, so the installer cannot read or write
; a longer PATH (real ones are often longer; Txais's is 1,815). It leaves that PATH exactly as it is and drops
; a hand-off file, ${KOLUX_PATH_PENDING}, in the install folder instead; Kolux adds the bin folder when it next
; starts and deletes the file first, so this happens once per install (cli_register.rs path_at_start). On
; uninstall the app itself runs first (<app>.exe --uninstall-path, cli_register.rs path_at_uninstall), which
; takes off exactly our entry at any length; the NSIS removal below then finds nothing of ours, and only does
; the work when the app could not run.
; ponytail: the long-PATH work is done by the app's own Rust code, not NSIS; upgrade, if the app could ever
; be missing at uninstall: the same steps through the System plugin into a buffer of the value's own size.
