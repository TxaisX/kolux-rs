// ONB-024 (FIX-1): the setup card an Explore Kolux stop draws, tested through the real StopSetup.
// There is no DOM test renderer in this repo (see sidebarStart.test.ts), so the component is called
// as a function with settings supplied by a stand-in for useSettings that can answer late; useRef
// is swapped for a slot that survives between draws. The returned element tree is walked for the
// controls, and their handlers are called the way React would call them.
