// the agent sets still says whether it is busy (STAT-033's titleState), and the title patterns of
// MiMo, Pi-style agents and Cursor are recognised so that a title naming a DIFFERENT agent (Cursor
// running a Claude model, say) is not taken as anybody's state: the named agent is claimed only when
// the dot (the title) and the row (the launch record) agree. Pure, so every rule is tested here;
// App.tsx and TerminalPane.tsx call it (evidence/hooks-T-257-*.patch).
