// T-164-b / TERM-047: Reopen Closed Tab for terminal tabs. The window (App.tsx) calls three things:
// rememberClosedPanes() where tabs are dropped, takeReopen() on Mod+Shift+T, and paneFor() +
// placement() to put the tab back. The ring itself is the terminal lane's (src/terminal/closedTabs.ts,
// newest first, ten entries); this file adds what that file leaves to the caller: the record shape, the
// "does this folder exist" answer, and the order against closed browser pages (one Mod+Shift+T
// undoes the newest close of either kind). Browser pages keep their own ring in src/browser/pages.ts.
