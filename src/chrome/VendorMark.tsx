// Model marks: a vendor's own public symbol stands for its agent (nominative use; Txais's call
// of 2026-10-08: vendor logos come only from public brand kits). The files live in
// src/assets/vendors with their source, terms and hash in NOTICE.md, and src/marks/registry.ts
// is the one table that says which agent or tool wears which file (T-335). An id with no kit file
// gets Kolux's neutral spark glyph and its name. A plain shell keeps Kolux's neutral prompt glyph
// (TERM-020).
