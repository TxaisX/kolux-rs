// installs every value the store cannot make itself: the annotation that marks Kolux's own change and
// the read of it, the undo grouping a reload gets (isolateHistory, compared by identity with the
// history extension, so it must come from this package, never a copy), the line separator compartment
// a view splits on, the text split into lines the way that view splits it, and — DT-C57 — the field
// that holds a mixed file's per-line endings beside its document.
