// EDIT-043 (T-237-a): Open in another editor or the file manager. The apps come from General
// settings (`openInApps`, a list of { label, command }); out of the box that is VS Code. The
// system file manager is always offered last. Rows lacking a label or a command are discarded and
// the list holds at most MAX_APPS; an app whose command is empty at launch falls back to VS Code's.
// The folder is opened by the open_in command (files.rs), which refuses relative or missing paths
// and reports a launch that fails. Managing the list in General settings is T-237-b.
