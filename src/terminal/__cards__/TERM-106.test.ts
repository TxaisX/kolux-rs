// TERM-106 box 2: a tab the user closed on purpose before the crash does not come back. The saved layout is what a restart
// rebuilds the tabs from; it is written (debounced) from the live tabs after the close, and read back by restoreLayout.
// MIRROR src/App.tsx:2041 dropPanes (`setPanes(ps => ps.filter(not closed))`) and App.tsx:1568 (layoutOf of the live panes ->
// layoutWriter.set): the decision that the closed tab is absent lives in layoutOf / layoutWriter / restoreLayout (imported).
