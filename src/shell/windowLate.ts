// Cycle 2 (the App.tsx split): what the window's action factories (launch/launchActions.ts,
// terminal/paneActions.ts, editor/reviewActions.ts) read from the window when an action runs, not when
// they are made. In App.tsx these actions were closures over values the window makes further down its
// render (a later hook, a later ref); the window now hands the factories one object per render, `w`,
// and fills it before it draws, so an action made in a render reads that render's values, as before.
// ponytail: the values are typed here by hand, where the factories' own types would be circular; a new
// late value needs a line here. Upgrade path: move the hooks that make them above the factories.
