// TERM-056 / STAT-035: what a terminal tab shows and what its hover says. Generated titles are a
// setting, off by default: on, a tab with no name of its own gets a short name drawn from its task
// (the worker's task label) or, without one, from the agent and the branch or folder it runs in.
// A name the user typed always wins; the full title is always the tooltip (the tab itself is clipped
// by CSS at 160 px). T-124-b owns the Settings switch; this is the title source it reads.
